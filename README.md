ðŸš€ Just Launched: AI Chatbot Powered by LangChain + Ollama + Streamlit! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬
I'm excited to share a personal project I've been working on â€” an AI-powered chatbot built using:
âœ… LangChain for orchestration
âœ… Ollama running the Gemma model locally
âœ… Wikipedia Tool integration for real-time knowledge
âœ… Streamlit for a simple and interactive UI
ðŸ§  The chatbot maintains conversation context, pulls live information from Wikipedia, and responds just like a virtual assistant would. It's named "Ahmed Kamel Chatbot", but you can easily adapt it to your own persona or use case!
This project helped me:
â€¢	Work with open-source LLMs locally
â€¢	Integrate tools like Wikipedia using LangChain
â€¢	Manage chat memory and display an interactive chat history
ðŸ’¡ Feel free to clone it, customize it, or reach out if youâ€™d like a walkthrough!
